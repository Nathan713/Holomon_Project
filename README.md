## Brief Introduction to HoloMon

The goal of this project is to create a holographic pokemon that a user can interact with using gesture based recognition and a webcam. We received permission from The Pokémon Company (North America) to utilize Pokémon assets for solely educational purposes, which is the intent behind this project. In a sense, the team aims to create a proof of concept for what can be the next step in bridging the gap between reality and virtual entertainment systems without the need for special AR/VR glasses / wearable technology.
